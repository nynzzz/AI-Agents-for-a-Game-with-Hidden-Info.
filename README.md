## Project_2.1_06

# Description:

Sneakthrough is a chess variation created specifically for Ludii. It shares similarities with BreakThrough, but in
Sneakthrough, there's a unique twist involving the opponent's pieces.

# Rules:

- When a piece is captured, it becomes visible to the opponent.
- If you attempt to make an orthogonal move to a square containing an opponent's hidden piece, the move is halted, and the enemy piece is uncovered.
- The objective is to advance to the opposite side of the board, similar to the goal in Breakthrough.

# To run the code:

- Open the executable JAR `Project_2.1_06.jar`
- JAR is located at: `out/artifacts/Project_2_1_06_jar/Project_2.1_06.jar`

Or

- build the project
- run `src/main/java/sneakthrough/Main.java`
